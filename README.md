This repository has the submitted reports for the hackathon by the participants.
My website is on the backery & Restuarant theme .
It was my First hackathon competiion .
we had 48 hours to make a Front end Website with  a task of making 3o dishes list in it.
I am tried my best to maked it but I am unable to make full  website still I am happy because i learned lot of things while making it.
In my website for background image & logo making I used Canva .
It helps me lot for designing my front end.
I used html and css Technology in my website.
